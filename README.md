# Hi There 👋 
# This is William, a guy actively exploring computational and cognitive neuroscience and trying to combine it with brain-machine interfaces.

Welcome to my research portfolio. This repository not only hosts the research projects I'm working on but also some naive ideas and proposals that will become reality someday. Or maybe just a repository for my personal experiences exploring the human brain.

## 🧠 Research Projects

### 1. [A hippocampal population code for rapid generalization](Project_Drift.md)
* **Status:** Pre-print, online https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.15.643456v1
* **Summary:** We discovered CA1 population activity uses a disentangled code for location, time, and choice; CA3 and MEC inputs set spatial remapping, while local CA1 PV-interneuron drives representational drift. 

### 2. [Hippocampus Constructs and Maintains Cognitive Maps of Social Territories](Project_Fieldwork.md)
* **Status:** In Prep / Unpublished Manuscript 
* **Summary:** We investigated hippocampal place cell activity in male mice living in a semi-natural outdoor enclosure (2000× larger than standard mazes).

### 3. [Long-term, large-scale neural recordings across memory circuits with high-density flexible probes](Project_Fabrication.md)
* **Status:** In Prep / Unpublished Manuscript 
* **Summary:** We developed a polymer-based flexible thin-film probe to overcome the tissue–device mismatch observed with conventional rigid Si probes, enabling long-term single-neuron tracking.

## 📝 Research Proposals (stay tuned, more will be released)

### 1. [Closed-coop prioritized hippocampal replay in brain-machine interface of value-biased choice](Proposal#1.md)
* **Topic:** Brain Machine Interfaces, hippocampal replay, and reinforcement learning
* **Summary:** A closed-loop BMI experiment to investigate whether hippocampal sequences function as "prioritized experience replay" by selectively reinforcing high-value trajectories in real-time to accelerate learning in a probabilistic T-maze task.
