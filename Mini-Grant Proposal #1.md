## Abstract
Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) and hippocampal neural sequences are crucial for spatial navigation and memory. In artificial reinforcement learning (RL), prioritized experience replay accelerates learning by oversampling high-value experiences from the replay buffer. However, whether hippocampal replay is systematically organized by choice value or can be causally biased to accelerate learning remains unknown. Here we propose a hippocampal brain-machine interface (BMI) experiment while rats will perform a probabilistic virtual-reality T-maze with asymmetric rewards, with higher-reward arm pseudo-randomly assigned across sessions. We aim to first decode place cell sequences within individual theta cycles and SWR events to quantify value-dependent biases toward the higher-reward arm and assess whether these biases predict trial-by-trial choices. Then, we aim to implement a closed-loop “prioritized replay” by delivering brief optogenetic stimulation when SWR replay represents the high-reward arm, and compare learning speed and sequence metrics to control sessions. I predict that selectively reinforcing high-value replay will increase replay priority, strengthen prospective sweep bias, and accelerate acquisition of the optimal route. This work will inform the mechanisms underlying episodic memory and imagination.
