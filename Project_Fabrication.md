## Abstract
Conventional commercial silicon probes have been widely adopted in systems neuroscience but exhibit fundamental limitations due to their mechanical rigidity. The substantial mechanical mismatch between the rigid probe and soft brain tissue often results in chronic inflammation and neuronal damage, ultimately compromising the ability to record at single-cell resolution over extended periods. As a result, many neuroscientists have historically turned to calcium imaging techniques for cellular- resolution studies. Calcium imaging enables simultaneous observation of a large population of neurons, provides access to dendritic morphology, and allows optical visualization of activity patterns. However, this approach suffers from poor temporal resolution, rendering it unsuitable for capturing millisecond-scale neural dynamics. Furthermore, it offers limited access to multi-regional circuit-level interactions and is susceptible to photobleaching, particularly beyond two weeks, which limits long-term cell tracking.

To address these challenges, we developed a high-density electrophysiological probe using ultrathin polymer-based materials, specifically Parylene-C, which possesses a Young's modulus over 1,000 times closer to that of neural tissue compared to silicon. This dramatically reduces mechanical mismatch and enables seamless integration with brain tissue. Additionally, the biochemically inert nature of Parylene-C minimizes immune responses, facilitating stable long-term recordings. With this tool, we targeted the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus to chronically track place cells, and simultaneously recorded from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to examine how cell assemblies in PFC evolve during memory consolidation. Our flexible probe technology, in contrast to the ~2–3 week lifespan of conventional silicon probes, enables reliable recordings spanning several months to over a year, thus opening new avenues for studying long-term memory and cognitive mapping.
