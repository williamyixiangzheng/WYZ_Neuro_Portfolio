# Hippocampus Constructs and Maintains Cognitive Maps of Social Territories in a Natural Environment

**In Prep / Unpublished**

## Abstract
The neural basis of rodent’s spatial and social behaviors is typically studied in controlled laboratory settings that do not fully reflect the complexity of these behaviors in natural environments. In nature, mice establish and defend territories while displaying aggressive social behaviors, yet how the brain represents and uses environmental and social cues to guide such territorial behavior remains unknown. 

We investigated how hippocampal activity patterns important for learning and memory are modulated by spatial and social organization in male mice living in an outdoor field enclosure (**2000× larger than standard lab mazes**). Through extended field experience, male mice developed sophisticated home range behaviors: they claimed specific areas, actively surveyed their social environment, and engaged in systematic patrolling and invader deterrence—behaviors that emerged and strengthened over time in the naturalistic setting. Hippocampal place cells showed context-dependent firing patterns at home range boundaries and social encounter zones. Cell assemblies conjunctively encoded both spatial and social variables, suggesting the hippocampus constructs cognitive maps integrating territorial and social information. These findings demonstrate that **spatial representation and social context are interdependent in hippocampal coding**, providing insight into how the brain guides natural territorial behaviors in ecologically relevant environments.
